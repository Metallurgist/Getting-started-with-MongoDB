# Getting started with MongoDB

**PyMongo** is a Python distribution containing tools for working with **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python. This **[MongoDB Documentation](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** attempts to explain everything you need to know to use PyMongo.

**Installing with pip**
```
pip install pymongo
```
**Dependencies**

The correct dependency can be installed automatically along with PyMongo:
Support for mongodb+srv:// URIs requires dnspython:
```
pip install "pymongo[srv]"
```
